Welcome to openva_pipeline's documentation!
===========================================

The `OpenVA Pipeline
<https://github.com/verbal-autopsy-software/openva_pipeline>`_ automates the
processing of verbal autopsy (VA) data from an `ODK Aggregate server
<https://docs.opendatakit.org/aggregate-intro/>`_, through the `openVA
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openVA/index.html>`_ library from the
`R <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_ statistical software, and ending with a
DHIS2 server (with the `VA program
<https://github.com/SwissTPH/dhis2_va_draft>`_).  A friendly graphical user
interface to R is also provided via an `RShiny app
<https://github.com/verbal-autopsy-software/shinyVA>`_ and
vignette.
