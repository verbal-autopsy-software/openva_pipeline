Welcome to openva_pipeline's documentation!
===========================================

The `OpenVA Pipeline
<https://github.com/verbal-autopsy-software/openva_pipeline>`_ automates the
processing of verbal autopsy (VA) data from an `ODK Central server
<https://docs.getodk.org/central-intro/>`_, through the `openVA
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openVA/index.html>`_ library of VA
algorithms from the `R <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_ statistical software,
to a DHIS2 server (with the `VA DHIS2 Program <https://github.com/verbal-autopsy-software/DHIS2_VA_program>`_).
