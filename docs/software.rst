Software Requirements
=====================

The following software is required by the openVA pipeline (note: installation instructions are found on a different page)

* `Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

   * `PIP <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_  (tool for installing Python packages)

   * `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_  (tool for creating virtual environments)

*  `OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net>`_ or
   `Java JDK 11 <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html>`_,
* `R <https://cran.r-project.org>`_
* `SQLite3 <https://www.sqlite.org>`_
* `SQLCipher <https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher>`_

It is also useful to install `DB Browser <https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/BUILDING.md>`_  for SQLite.  This
optional tool is useful for configuring the Pipeline (i.e., configuration tables in the SQLite Database).
